# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains basic implementation of a set of common data structures and algorithms in Java for the _Udemy_ online course _Practical Data Structures & Algorithms in Java_.

The available data structures are:

* Stack
* Queue
* Singly-linked list
* Circular-linked list
* Doubly-linked list
* Binary search tree

Whereas, the available algorithms are:

* Linear search
* Binary search (both iterative and recursive versions)
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
